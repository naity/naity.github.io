In essence, we have both image and structured or tabular data for each example. For the image, we can use a CNN-based model, and for the tabular data, we can use embeddings and fully connected layers as explored in my previous posts on UFC and League of Legends predictions. It is easy to build two separate models for each data modality. But what if we want to build a joint model that trains on both data modalities simultaneously? There are inspiring discussions in the competition forum including this thread. In this post, I will demonstrate how to integrate the two data modalities and train a joint deep learning model using fastai and the image_tabular library, which I created specifically for these tasks.

More recently, exciting technologies such as cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) have been developed to extend scRNA-seq by jointly measuring multiple molecular modalities such as proteome and transcriptome from the same cell as illustrated in the figure below. By utilizing antibodies that are conjugated to oligonucleotides, CITE-seq simultaneously generates sequencing-based readouts for surface protein expression along with gene expression. Since gene and protein expressions convey distinct and complementary information about a cell, CITE-seq offers a unique opportunity to combine both transcriptomic and proteomic data to decipher the biology of individual cells at a considerably higher resolution than using either one alone. This requires computational methods that can effectively integrate single-cell data from both modalities.

Since the introduction of the first commercial CyTOF mass cytometer by DVS Sciences in 2009, mass cytometry technology has matured and become more widely utilized, with sequential platform upgrades designed to address specific limitations and to expand the capabilities of the platform. Fluidigm's third-generation Helios mass cytometer introduced a number of upgrades over the previous CyTOF2. One of these new features is a modified narrow bore sample injector that generates smaller ion clouds, which is expected to improve sensitivity and throughput. However, following rigorous testing, we find that the narrow-bore sample injector may have unintended negative consequences on data quality and result in lower median and higher coefficients of variation in many antibody-associated signal intensities. We describe an alternative Helios acquisition protocol using a wider bore injector, which largely mitigates these data quality issues. We directly compare these two protocols in a multisite study of 10 Helios instruments across 7 institutions and show that the modified protocol improves data quality and reduces interinstrument variability. These findings highlight and address an important source of technical variability in mass cytometry experiments that is of particular relevance in the setting of multicenter studies.

Since the introduction of the first commercial CyTOF mass cytometer by DVS Sciences in 2009, mass cytometry technology has matured and become more widely utilized, with sequential platform upgrades designed to address specific limitations and to expand the capabilities of the platform. Fluidigmâs third-generation Helios mass cytometer introduced a number of upgrades over the previous CyTOF2. One of these new features is a modified narrow bore sample injector that generates smaller ion clouds, which is expected to improve sensitivity and throughput. However, following rigorous testing, we find that the narrow-bore sample injector may have unintended negative consequences on data quality and result in lower median and higher coefficients of variation in many antibody-associated signal intensities. We describe an alternative Helios acquisition protocol using a wider bore injector, which largely mitigates these data quality issues. We directly compare these two protocols in a multisite study of 10 Helios instruments across 7 institutions and show that the modified protocol improves data quality and reduces interinstrument variability.

Memory CD8 T cells can be further subdivided into central memory, effector memory (TEM), and tissue-resident memory (TRM) subsets, which cooperate to confer immunological protection. Using mixed bone marrow chimeras and adoptive transfer studies in which CD8 T cells either do or do not express IL-21R, we discovered that under homeostatic or lymphopenic conditions IL-21 acts directly on CD8 T cells to favor the accumulation of TE/TEM populations. The inability to perceive IL-21 signals under competitive conditions also resulted in lower levels of TRM phenotype cells and reduced expression of granzyme B in the small intestine. IL-21 differentially promoted the expression of the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 and the integrin Î±4Î²7 on CD8 T cells primed in vitro and on circulating CD8 T cells in the mixed bone marrow chimeras. The requirement for IL-21 to establish CD8 TE/TEM and TRM subsets was overcome by acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection; nevertheless, memory virus-specific CD8 T cells remained dependent on IL-21 for optimal accumulation in lymphopenic environments. Overall, this study reveals a context-dependent role for IL-21 in sustaining effector phenotype CD8 T cells and influencing their migratory properties, accumulation, and functions.","date":"03/01/2016","objectID":"/publications/il-21-paper/","tags":null,"title":"A context-dependent role for IL-21 in modulating the differentiation, distribution, and abundance of effector and memory CD8 T cell subsets","uri":"/publications/il-21-paper/"},{"categories":["Peer-reviewed Papers"],"content":"Authors Yuan Tian, Maureen A Cox, Shannon M Kahan, Jennifer T Ingram, Rakesh K Bakshi, Allan J Zajac ","date":"03/01/2016","objectID":"/publications/il-21-paper/:1:0","tags":null,"title":"A context-dependent role for IL-21 in modulating the differentiation, distribution, and abundance of effector and memory CD8 T cell subsets","uri":"/publications/il-21-paper/"},{"categories":["Peer-reviewed Papers"],"content":"Journal The journal of immunology 196 (5), 2153-2166 ","date":"03/01/2016","objectID":"/publications/il-21-paper/:2:0","tags":null,"title":"A context-dependent role for IL-21 in modulating the differentiation, distribution, and abundance of effector and memory CD8 T cell subsets","uri":"/publications/il-21-paper/"},{"categories":["Peer-reviewed Papers"],"content":"Abstract The activation of naive CD8 T cells typically results in the formation of effector cells (TE) as well as phenotypically distinct memory cells that are retained over time.
